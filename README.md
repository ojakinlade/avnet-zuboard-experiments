# avnet-zuboard-experiments

This repository contains my personal experiments and learning projects using the [Avnet ZUBoard 1CG](https://www.avnet.com/americas/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/zuboard-1cg/) FPGA development board. Projects range from low-level RTL design using **Verilog/SystemVerilog** to more advanced work involving **block design** and **hardware/software co-design**.

My overarching goal is to explore **hardware/software co-design**, with a focus on applications in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. This includes leveraging the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC architecture for efficient, embedded AI acceleration.
